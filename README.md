Resea
======

Resea [rìːséə] is a whole new operating system kernel that you can toy around with.

Resea is:

- **modular:** all components are isolated as *packages*
- **consitent:** the only one IPC is the unfied, structured, simple message passing
- **seamless:** all applications can be run in both kernel-space and user-space seamlessly
- **adaptable:** environment-neutral, language-neutral, and absolutes are only few
- **user friendly:** easy-to-understand specifications and sane SDK
